# FixAm 9ja Supabase Setup

1. Open your Supabase project.
2. Go to SQL Editor.
3. Paste and run `supabase/schema.sql`.
4. Go to Project Settings > API.
5. Copy the Project URL and anon public key into `supabase-config.js`.
6. Create an admin user in Authentication > Users.
7. Add the admin user to `public.admin_profiles`.

Use this after creating the Supabase Auth user, replacing the email:

```sql
insert into public.admin_profiles (user_id, email)
select id, email
from auth.users
where email = 'you@example.com'
on conflict (user_id) do update set email = excluded.email;
```

The public website only gets insert access to `quote_requests` and `artisan_applications`. Anonymous visitors cannot read, update, or delete quote requests or applications because no public policies are created for those actions.
